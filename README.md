*** This is intended for use by the F2p Starhunt Discord. ***

The map starts off in Grayscale and then as you click target locations, chunks of the map will regain their full color until the entire map is full color.

The clicking functionality is binary, on and off.

The point of this is to be a part of an easy to use system that helps scouts identify which locations have been scouted by others so they never waste their time.

This part of that system mainly is useful for the visual display which allows scouts to quickly glance at a map for information rather than reading through small text.
